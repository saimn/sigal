""" This plugin controls the generation of a ZIP archive for a gallery

If the ``zip_gallery`` setting is set, it contains the location of a zip
archive with all original images of the corresponding directory.

To ignore a ZIP gallery generation for a particular album, put
a ``.nozip_gallery`` file next to it in its parent folder. Only the existence
of this ``.nozip_gallery`` file is tested.  If no ``.nozip_gallery`` file is
present, then make a ZIP archive with all media files.

See :ref:`compatibility with the encrypt plugin <compatibility-with-encrypt>`.
